The official means of input / output of funds are the Company's purses / accounts in those payment systems listed on the Company's website. All risks associated with the use of payment systems are accepted by the Customer, since payment systems are not partners of the Company. The Company is not responsible for the delay and / or non-receipt of funds to the balance of the Customer's account through the fault of the payment system. In the event that claims arise from the Client for the correct operation of payment systems, the Customer should contact the support of such a payment system. The client is obliged to notify of cases of such appeals. The Company shall not be liable for the actions of third parties engaged in intermediary activity when conducting operations involving the introduction / withdrawal of funds by the Customer. When the Client conducts operations for the deposit of funds, the Company's financial responsibility starts from the moment the Customer's funds are received on the Company's bank account and / or the Company's account in the payment systems indicated on the Company's website. In case of revealing the signs of fraud in the implementation of financial transactions after crediting funds to the balance of the Customer's account, the Company reserves the right to cancel this transaction and freeze the customer's account.

After the Client sends a request for withdrawal of funds, the request receives the status "Sent". When the request is processed, it receives the status "In processing". After assigning the status "In processing", the requested funds are debited from the balance on the Client's account. After the withdrawal request is "Processed", the requested funds are transferred to the payment system. Requests for withdrawal of funds are processed by the Company's financial department in the order of the queue. Processing time is 24 hours. The company reserves the right to increase the processing time of the application. The client has the right to withdraw funds only through the payment system, which was used to deposit funds into his account.
