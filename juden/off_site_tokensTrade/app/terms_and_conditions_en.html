After assigning the status “In Processing”, the requested funds are deducted from the balance on the Client’s account. After the withdrawal request receives the “Processed” status, the requested funds are transferred to the payment system. Withdrawal requests are processed by the Company's financial department in turn. Processing time is 24 hours. The company reserves the right to increase the processing time of the application. The client has the right to withdraw funds only through the payment system that was used to deposit funds into his account. If it is technically impossible to withdraw funds through the payment system that was used to deposit funds, the payment method is chosen by the Company in accordance with the wishes of the Client. In this case, the payment details must correspond to the data specified by the Customer in the personal information. The client is fully responsible for the information provided to the Company in the withdrawal request. In the event that the Client uses a bank card for depositing funds, withdrawals must be made to this card for an amount not exceeding the deposit amount from this card for a period of 90 (ninety) calendar days from the moment funds are entered. Payments to bank cards have a higher priority than other methods of withdrawing funds. The withdrawal time may vary from 1 to 5 working days, but processing may take longer due to various factors, including, among other things, the speed of the digital network and / or the ability to process requests for withdrawal, in which case the Company is not responsible for any delays and / or losses caused to Clients.</p><p class="wow fadeInUp section2__identation"></p><p class="wow fadeInUp section2__text">11.3.
